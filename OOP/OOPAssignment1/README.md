# OOP Assignment #1

In this assignment we need to create two classes:
    * Polynomial
    * Rational

These classes will represent Polynomial and Rational as familiar in Mathmatics.

Instructions:
    * Each Polynomial will be represented as an instance of Polynomial class.
    * A Polynomial's degree can not be changed after initialization, therefor it will be a const variable.
    * Use reference(&) and const syntax where neccesery.
    * Rational will be represented as two Polynomial - Numerator and Denominator.

Results should be match to the results in the result.txt file
